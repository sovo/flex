<h1>Flexbox First Look</h1>
<h2>Additional Resources</h2>
<p>Thanks for watching Flexbox First Look! I wanted to share some additional resources on Flexbox that will help you learn more about Flexbox and track support for it.</p>
</header>
<h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/" title="Flexbox">CSS Flexible Box Layout Module</a></h3>
<p>The best way to learn Flexbox is to dive into the specification itself. It doesn't take long to read, and you'll learn plenty of details that I was unable to go into over the length of this course. Dive in!</p>
<h3><a href="http://caniuse.com/flexbox" title="Can I use Flexbox?">Can I Use Flexbox?</a></h3>
<p>Bookmark caniuse.com's page on Flexbox support and keep track of Flexbox and how it's supported across multiple browsers and devices.</p>
<h3><a href="http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/flexbox-2009-2011-spec-property-mapping" title="2009/2011 syntax">CSS Flexbox 2009/2011 syntax mapping</a></h3>
<p>Nice quick reference on the difference between the 2009 and 2011 Flexbox syntax. Keep in mind that the 2011 syntax is considered the &quot;tweener&quot; syntax and is not current.</p>
<h3><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673531(v=vs.85).aspx" title="IE Flexbox reference">IE Flexbox reference</a></h3>
<p>Thorough overview of the Flexbox implementation in IE10. Contains all vendor prefixes for -ms- values and explains tweener syntax.</p>
<h3><a href="http://css-tricks.com/old-flexbox-and-new-flexbox/" title="Old .vs new syntax">Old Flexbox .vs New Flexbox</a></h3>
<p>Chris Coyier has a nice post here on how to detect the difference between older Flexbox syntax and the newer syntax.</p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/flexbox-basics/" title="Flexbox, fast track to layout nirvana?">Flexbox - Fast Track to Layout Nirvana?</a></h3>
<p>Fantastic article by Chris Mills that delves into Flexbox, it's history, and the pros and cons of using it.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4580" title="Why Flexbox isn't good for page layout">Why Flexboxes Aren't Good for Page Layout</a></h3>
<p>A leading title to be sure, but Flexbox spec editor Tab Atkins talks about Flexbox, what it's designed to do, and how it will eventually work with other layout modules.</p>
<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/jameswillweb" title="The Twitter">Follow me on Twitter!</a></h3>
<p>I don't always talk about Flexbox, but I'd love to hear from you!</p>
